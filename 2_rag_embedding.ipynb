He has been under the care of our clinic since July 31, 1997. Today, he presents for a comprehensive follow-up evaluation regarding chronic neck and lower back pain, as well as persistent sinus and upper respiratory concerns.\\n\\nThe patient reports that his neck pain, which radiates to his shoulders, has been present for several years. The discomfort magnifies with prolonged sitting, especially during computer work, and is somewhat improved with rest, though never completely alleviated. He also describes his lower back pain as a constant, dull ache exacerbated by physical activity.\\n\\nIn addition to these musculoskeletal issues, the patient reports experiencing frequent sinusitis and bouts of pharyngitis characterized by sore throat and general malaise. He also mentions experiencing occasional nasal congestion and discharge, alongside headaches mainly centered around the forehead and cheeks. These episodes generally last for several days and have been recurrent over the past few years.\\n\\nThe patient’s medical history includes well-controlled alopecia and atopic dermatitis, with the latter managed using topical emollients. He has also dealt with instances of viral warts, which are currently inactive. He has no significant surgical history or known drug allergies.\\n\\nMedications he is currently on include NSAIDs for pain management which provide partial relief, Diastat for temporary anxiety management, Kenalog for atopic dermatitis flare-ups, and occasional use of Zithromax for severe infections. He has been compliant with his medication regimen and reports no adverse effects.\\n\\nHe leads a sedentary lifestyle due to his desk job but engages in social activities. He does not smoke, drinks alcohol socially, and maintains a balanced diet. He lives alone but has a supportive family living nearby. The patient reports a pain severity of 6 out of 10 and states no recent change in condition or new symptoms. Non-pharmacological measures like physical therapy offered only limited short-term relief.\\n\\n**Objective:**\\n\\nVital signs are as follows: blood pressure 125/82 mmHg, heart rate 70 bpm, respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, temperature 37°C, and oxygen saturation at 99% on room air. \\n\\nOn general examination, the patient appears well-nourished, alert, and oriented, with no signs of acute distress. Cardiovascular examination reveals a regular rhythm with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs. The respiratory examination shows clear lungs bilaterally without wheezes or crackles.\\n\\nAbdominal examination reveals a soft, non-tender abdomen without organomegaly, masses, or bruits. The musculoskeletal examination identifies tenderness over the cervical and lumbar spine regions with palpable muscle spasms. The range of motion is limited by pain, particularly noticeable during flexion and extension. No deformities are observed.\\n\\nNeurological examination shows intact cranial nerves with no focal deficits. Reflexes are symmetric, and both sensory and motor functions are intact. Skin examination indicates no new lesions, signs of active atopic dermatitis, or viral warts.\\n\\nRecent laboratory tests indicate normal albumin and total protein. Creatinine levels are slightly elevated but stable. Liver function tests, including AST and bilirubin, are within normal limits. Complete blood count and differential are unremarkable, though a repeated differential will be performed to monitor any potential changes.\\n\\n**Assessment:**\\n\\n1. Chronic neck and lower back pain, likely due to musculoskeletal strain aggravated by poor ergonomics.\\n   - Differential diagnoses include myofascial pain syndrome and degenerative disc disease.\\n  \\n2. Recurrent sinusitis and pharyngitis, suggestive of chronic upper respiratory tract infections.\\n   - Differential includes allergic rhinitis and chronic sinusitis.\\n\\n3. Alopecia and atopic dermatitis, currently well-controlled.\\n   - Differential consists of eczema and contact dermatitis.\\n\\n**Plan:**\\n\\n1. Chronic neck and back pain:\\n   - Continue NSAIDs for pain relief and consider introducing muscle relaxants for muscle spasms.\\n   - Referral to physical therapy for core strengthening and posture correction exercises.\\n   - Recommend an ergonomic review of the patient’s workspace to improve posture and reduce strain while working.\\n   - Evaluate for potential referral to a pain management specialist if pain persists despite current measures.\\n\\n2. Recurrent sinusitis and pharyngitis:\\n   - Initiate a nasal corticosteroid spray to reduce mucosal inflammation.\\n   - Suggest using saline nasal irrigation for symptomatic relief of nasal congestion.\\n   - Consider prescribing a course of antibiotics such as Zithromax if bacterial infection is suspected in severe cases.\\n   - Plan for ENT referral if symptoms do not improve or recur frequently.\\n\\n3. Alopecia and atopic dermatitis:\\n   - Continue using topical emollients.\\n   - Advise avoiding known irritants and continuing the use of hypoallergenic skincare products.\\n\\n**Follow-Up:**\\n\\nInstruct the patient to contact the clinic if symptoms worsen or do not improve within a week or if new symptoms arise.

The exacerbation could be due to environmental triggers or insufficient asthma control.\\n\\n### Plan:\\n1. **Asthma Exacerbation**:\\n    - Measure peak expiratory flow and consider repeating spirometry to assess current pulmonary function.\\n    - Increase the dosage of Qvar temporarily and encourage frequent use of Atrovent as a rescue inhaler.\\n    - Prescribe a short course of oral corticosteroids, such as prednisone, if there is no significant improvement within the next 48-72 hours.\\n    - Follow-up in 1 week with a primary care provider or sooner if symptoms worsen.\\n    - Consider a referral to a pulmonologist if symptoms persist despite the above measures.\\n\\n2. **Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity**:\\n    - Maintain the current regimen of methylphenidate.\\n    - Evaluate the need for additional behavioral or cognitive therapies.\\n    - Utilize the Vanderbilt ADHD Diagnostic Teacher Rating Scale to monitor progress.\\n    - Consider a potential referral to a pediatric psychiatrist for further management if ADHD symptoms become unmanageable.\\n\\n3. **Developmental Dyslexia and Speech Disturbances**:\\n    - Continue ongoing speech and occupational therapies.\\n    - Recommend re-evaluation of academic accommodations and support through the university’s disability services.\\n    - Encourage educational tutoring specifically tailored to his learning needs.\\n\\n### Follow-Up:\\nInstruct the patient to contact the clinic if symptoms do not improve within one week or if they worsen. Schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to reassess his asthma management and to further address any ADHD and academic concerns. Reiterate the importance of medication adherence, recognizing early signs of an asthma exacerbation, and maintaining regular follow-up appointments. Confirm that the patient and his family understand and agree with the treatment plan, including the necessity of closely monitoring respiratory symptoms.', \"### Visit Information:\\n- **Patient Num**: 1000000008\\n- **Visit Date**: 06/19/2010\\n\\nThis is a 25-year-old Hispanic male who has been a patient at our clinic for several years. He frequently speaks German and presents today for a follow-up on his asthma management. The patient has a documented history of asthma of both unspecified types, with and without status asthmaticus, and experiencing multiple exacerbations. Recently, he reported significant worsening of asthma symptoms, including increased wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness, which have been particularly troublesome at night. These exacerbations are poorly controlled with his current rescue inhaler, and physical activities seem to aggravate his condition. In addition to asthma, the patient has a history of attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity (ADHD), developmental dyslexia, and speech disturbances. Other relevant medical history includes contact dermatitis, acute pharyngitis, and otitis media. He previously underwent circumcision due to redundant prepuce and phimosis.\\n\\nThe patient is currently taking Atrovent (18 mcg/inh) and Qvar (80 mcg/inh) for asthma management, and methylphenidate for ADHD, with reported good compliance. He lives with his parents, who are very supportive, and he is a diligent university student struggling academically due to ADHD and dyslexia. He has no known drug allergies.\\n\\nLately, he has been experiencing frequent nocturnal coughing and increased restlessness likely associated with exacerbated asthma and stress from academic demands. He denies fever or chills.\\n\\n### Objective:\\n- **Vital Signs**:\\n  - Blood Pressure: 118/76 mmHg\\n  - Heart Rate: 92 beats per minute\\n  - Respiratory Rate: 26 breaths per minute\\n  - Temperature: 98.4°F\\n  - Oxygen Saturation: 94% on room air\\n\\n- **General Appearance**: The patient appears well-nourished but visibly tired and anxious, noted to be frequently shifting and fidgeting.\\n- **Cardiovascular**: Regular heart rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.\\n- **Respiratory**: Use of accessory muscles visible. Scattered wheezes were heard bilaterally, more pronounced on expiration. No crackles or rhonchi were observed.\\n- **Abdomen**: Nondistended, soft, and nontender with normoactive bowel sounds. No hepatosplenomegaly evident.\\n- **Musculoskeletal**: Full range of motion and normal strength observed. Exhibits restlessness, typical of ADHD.\\n- **Neurological**: Alert, and oriented to person, place, time, and situation. Cranial nerves II-XII are intact.\\n- **Skin**: No new rashes or lesions were detected.\\n\\n### Assessment:\\nThe patient's principal concern involves an acute exacerbation of asthma, which is likely also contributing to increased anxiety and restlessness. His chronic conditions, including ADHD and developmental dyslexia, continue to significantly affect his daily activities and academic performance. The current asthma exacerbation could potentially be triggered by environmental factors or inadequate control through present medications.\\n\\n### Plan:\\n1. **Asthma Exacerbation**:\\n    - Perform peak expiratory flow measurements and consider repeating spirometry to evaluate lung function.\\n    - Temporarily increase the dose of Qvar and encourage frequent use of Atrovent as a rescue medication.\\n    - Prescribe a short course of oral corticosteroids, such as prednisone, should symptoms not improve within 48-72 hours.\\n    - Schedule a follow-up in one week with the primary care provider or immediately if symptoms worsen.\\n    - Consider referral to a pulmonologist if symptoms persist despite the above measures.\\n\\n2. **Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity**:\\n    - Maintain the current dosage of methylphenidate.\\n    - Evaluate the need for additional behavioral or cognitive therapies.\\n    - Monitor using the Vanderbilt ADHD Diagnostic Teacher Rating Scale.\\n    - Referral to a pediatric psychiatrist for further management if ADHD symptoms become unmanageable may be considered.\\n\\n3. **Developmental Dyslexia and Speech Disturbances**:\\n    - Continue with ongoing speech and occupational therapies.\\n    - Reassess academic accommodations and support from university disability services.\\n    - Encourage utilization of tutoring services tailored to his specific learning requirements.\\n\\n### Follow-Up:\\nThe patient is instructed to contact the clinic if symptoms do not improve within one week or if they worsen. Follow-up appointment is scheduled in two weeks to reassess asthma control and address any ADHD and academic concerns further. Reinforce the importance of adherence to prescribed medications, recognizing early signs of asthma exacerbation, and adhering to regular follow-up visits.

    "## 6. Retrieving Clinical Notes with Similarity and MMR Search\n",
    "This approach focuses on retrieving relevant clinical notes using different search methods, including similarity-based retrieval and Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Steps:**\n",
    "1. **Similarity Search (Item 6.1)**:\n",
    "   - Finds the most relevant clinical notes based on vector similarity.\n",
    "   - Retrieves documents that closely match the given query.\n",

    "   - Retrieves relevant documents along with their similarity scores.\n",
    "   - Enables ranking and filtering based on the confidence of relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Using a Retriever with Score Threshold (Item 6.3)**:\n",
    "   - Configures a retriever that automatically filters documents based on a minimum similarity score.\n",
    "   - Returns only the most relevant clinical notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) Search (Item 6.4)**:\n",
    "   - Balances relevance and diversity in search results.\n",
