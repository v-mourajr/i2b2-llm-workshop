    "# Using ChromaDB + Embeddings to Search Patient Notes (RAG)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to implement a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline using **local embeddings** and **ChromaDB** to search and analyze clinical notes stored in an i2b2-like format. It walks through decoding, embedding, storing, retrieving, and generating responses with a local LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will work through a complete pipeline:\n",
    "- Decode notes from BinHex format\n",
    "- Embed clinical notes using the MiniLM model\n",
    "- Store the notes and metadata in a persistent ChromaDB vector store\n",
    "- Perform semantic similarity search and inspect cosine-based scores\n",
    "- Apply **Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR)** to promote diversity and reduce redundancy\n",
    "- Retrieve only the **most recent note per patient** for clarity and accuracy\n",
    "- Inject results into a reusable prompt template\n",
    "- Generate structured, clinically meaningful responses using a local LLM (e.g., Qwen or LLaMA 3 via Ollama)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 Key Concepts Covered\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decoding i2b2-formatted BinHex clinical notes\n",
    "- Embedding full notes for semantic similarity search\n",
    "- Persistent storage and retrieval using ChromaDB\n",
    "- Score-based filtering and MMR ranking\n",
    "- Structured prompt engineering for LLMs\n",
    "- Zero-shot summarization with a local model\n",
    "\n",
    "Each cell builds on the last to demonstrate a complete RAG workflow, tailored to **clinical informatics and patient note analysis**.\n",

    "## 2. Decode, Embed, and Store Entire Clinical Notes in ChromaDB\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, we process and store each clinical note as a **complete document** in a ChromaDB vector store. This approach preserves full patient context, making it ideal for semantic search and downstream clinical reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2.1: Embed and Store Notes\n",
    "1. **Embed Full Notes**\n",
    "   Each note is converted into a semantic vector using a lightweight transformer model (`MiniLM`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Store in ChromaDB**\n",
    "   The embedded vector and its associated metadata (e.g., patient ID, encounter number, visit date) are stored together in a persistent ChromaDB directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Approach?\n",
    "\n",
    "Storing full notes is especially useful when:\n",
    "- You want to retrieve the complete narrative for clinical context\n",
    "- Your downstream task (e.g., summarization or decision support) depends on comprehensive input\n",
    "- Each note fits within the input limit of a single LLM call\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup supports more faithful summarization and reasoning than chunk-based approaches when notes are relatively short and self-contained.\n",

    "## 3. Retrieving Clinical Notes with Similarity Score (RAG Retrieval with ChromaDB)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we retrieve relevant clinical notes from a ChromaDB vector store using vector similarity techniques. We explore both standard and advanced retrieval strategies to improve the relevance and diversity of retrieved context for downstream LLM generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Retrieval Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define a Clinical Query**\n",
    "   - The user provides a natural language question (e.g., \"Who has asthma and is taking Fluticasone and Albuterol?\").\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Similarity Search with Scores (Step 3.2)**\n",
    "   - Retrieves the top-k notes ranked by semantic similarity to the query.\n",
    "   - Returns cosine-based relevance scores for each match.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Score Threshold Filtering (Step 3.3)**\n",
    "   - Filters out low-confidence matches using a minimum similarity score.\n",
    "   - Retains only notes that meet a defined relevance threshold (e.g., ≥ 0.6).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) Search (Step 3.4)**\n",
    "   - Balances similarity and diversity.\n",
    "   - Reduces redundancy by selecting a diverse subset of highly relevant notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use These Strategies?\n",
    "\n",
    "High-quality retrieval is critical to the success of RAG workflows. These techniques help:\n",
    "- Improve the contextual relevance of inputs to the LLM\n",
    "- Filter out irrelevant or low-confidence documents\n",
    "- Encourage diverse results to reduce bias and improve robustness\n",

    "\n",
    "In this final step, we use a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze the clinical notes retrieved in the previous section. By injecting these relevant notes into a structured prompt, we enable the LLM to generate clinically useful, structured responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "This completes the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, connecting search results to intelligent language generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a Prompt Template (Step 4.1)**\n",
    "   - Defines a reusable prompt structure that includes placeholders for both the query and the retrieved clinical context.\n",
    "   - Specifies a structured output format, including metadata fields such as patient ID, encounter date, and a clinical summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Invoke the LLM with Retrieved Context (Step 4.2)**\n",
    "   - Fills the prompt with retrieved notes and the clinical query.\n",
    "   - Sends the prompt to a local LLM (e.g., Qwen2 or LLaMA 3 via Ollama).\n",
    "   - Returns a structured, context-aware response to the clinical question.\n",
    "\n",

    "This generation step demonstrates the power of combining semantic search with generative AI:\n",
    "- Produces context-rich answers grounded in patient data\n",
    "- Supports clinical summarization and decision support\n",
