    "In this step, we process and store clinical notes as **entire documents** in a ChromaDB vector store. This preserves complete patient-level context for semantic search and retrieval.\n",

    "### Key Steps (2.1):\n",
    "1. **Embed Full Notes**:\n",
    "   - Each clinical note is transformed into a semantic vector using a transformer-based embedding model.\n",
    "2. **Store in ChromaDB**:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Why Use This Approach?\n",
    "\n",
    "Storing full notes is valuable when:\n",
    "- You want to retrieve the entire clinical context (not just snippets or chunks)\n",
    "- The downstream task (e.g., summarization or decision support) benefits from broader information\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is most useful when each note is concise enough to fit within LLM input limits and clinical completeness is critical.\n",

    "## 4. Retrieving Clinical Notes with Similarity and MMR Search\n",
    "\n",
    "This section demonstrates how to retrieve relevant clinical notes from ChromaDB using multiple vector-based search strategies. We compare traditional **similarity search** with more advanced techniques like **Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Retrieval Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Similarity Search with Scores (Step 4.1)**\n",
    "   - Retrieves clinical notes ranked by semantic similarity to the input query.\n",
    "   - Returns relevance scores to support sorting and thresholding.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Score Threshold Filtering (Step 4.2)**\n",
    "   - Filters out low-confidence matches based on a minimum similarity score.\n",
    "   - Improves retrieval precision by returning only highly aligned documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) Search (Step 4.3)**\n",
    "   - Balances relevance and diversity in retrieved documents.\n",
    "   - Reduces redundancy while preserving contextual variety.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use These Strategies?\n",
    "\n",
    "Effective retrieval is critical to building high-quality RAG pipelines. These techniques help:\n",
    "- Improve contextual relevance of the retrieved clinical notes\n",
    "- Eliminate noisy or marginal matches\n",
    "- Encourage diversity in content to support more robust, less biased LLM outputs\n",

    "## 5. Generating Structured Responses with an LLM\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we take the clinical notes retrieved in the previous step and pass them into a Large Language Model (LLM) for analysis and summarization. This completes the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Creating a Prompt Template for LLM Querying (Step 5.1)**\n",
    "   - Defines a reusable prompt structure to guide the LLM in analyzing and summarizing clinical notes.\n",
    "   - Ensures the output is consistent, structured, and clinically useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Invoking AzureChatOpenAI with Retrieved Context (Step 5.2)**\n",
    "   - Inserts the retrieved documents into the prompt.\n",
    "   - Sends the final prompt to an LLM (e.g., Azure-hosted GPT-4 or GPT-4o) for generation.\n",
    "   - Outputs a structured answer to a medical query.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "This final step showcases how LLMs can generate rich, relevant summaries or extractions from retrieved clinical data. It is particularly useful for clinical decision support, patient summarization, or intelligent search.\n",

At his recent follow-up visit on June 10, 2005, he reported increased symptoms of wheezing, dyspnea during physical activity, and nocturnal cough which required an increased use of his Atrovent inhaler. Despite adherence to his current medication regimen, these symptoms had persisted, indicating suboptimal asthma control.\n\nPlan:\nAsthma management plan involves increasing the dosage of inhaled corticosteroids in combination with his inhaler therapy. A comprehensive asthma action plan will be created and a follow-up appointment scheduled for two weeks later to reassess symptom improvement and medication adherence. Respiration monitoring is recommended, especially for signs of respiratory infections, and preventive health measures including vaccinations are emphasized.\n\nPatient Num: 1000000110, Gender: Hispanic Male, Age: 36 years, Race: Hispanic\n\nEncounter: 481878, Visit Date: 11/13/2008\n\nSummary:\nA 36-year-old Hispanic male presented for a follow-up visit. He manages asthma with inhaled corticosteroids and has been dealing with coexisting conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, polymyositis, mononeuritis, sinusitis, anxiety, backache, and more. All were well-controlled under the current medication regimen.\n\nPlan:\nContinued management includes maintaining the prescribed asthma medication regimen while adding Augmentin for acute sinusitis that persists beyond 1-2 weeks. Non-pharmacological strategies are recommended for anxiety and backache, including Atarax on an as-needed basis and Ibuprofen as needed. There is also a plan to monitor mononeuritis symptoms, potentially requiring further neurologic evaluation if they persist or worsen.\n\nPatient Num: 1000000112 (repeated), Gender: Black Male, Age: 12 years, Race: Black\n\nEncounter: 477645, Visit Date: 06/10/2005\n\nSummary:\nA summary is repeated from the previous note as it covers a relevant patient under consideration.\n\nPlan:\nAs previously stated, this plan involves increasing the dosage of inhaled corticosteroids in combination with his inhaler therapy for asthma management. Respiration monitoring and preventive health measures including vaccinations are emphasized.\n\nPatient Num: 1000000110 (repeated), Gender: Hispanic Male, Age: 36 years, Race: Hispanic\n\nEncounter: 481878, Visit Date: 11/13/2008\n\nSummary:\nA summary is repeated from the previous note as it covers a relevant patient under consideration.\n\nPlan:\nContinued management includes maintaining the prescribed asthma medication regimen while adding Augmentin for acute sinusitis that persists beyond 1-2 weeks.

The summaries provide key details pertinent to their conditions, such as asthma management and coexisting conditions, along with specific plans tailored to their health issues."
