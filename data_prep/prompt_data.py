Visit Information:
    - Patient ID: {{patient_num}}
    - Encounter ID: {{encounter_id}}
    - Visit Date: {{visit_date}}

Subjective:
    - Chief Complaints & History of Present Illness:
        Provide a narrative description of the patient's current issues, reasons for visit, and history of presenting complaints.
    - Past Medical & Surgical History:
        Summarize relevant past medical conditions and previous surgeries.
    - Medications & Supplements:
        Describe current medications, herbal supplements, and the patient’s response to treatment. Write in narrative form using full sentences.

    - Additional Narrative:
        Include details on non-pharmacological interventions tried, the patient's experience managing symptoms, any side effects experienced, and any recent changes in condition. Write in full sentences.
    
Objective:
    Summarize the physical exam, vital signs, and lab findings in **a single paragraph**.
    Only include findings that relate directly to the patient's current complaints or diagnoses.
    Avoid listing systems with normal or unrelated findings.

Assessment:
    - Diagnosis or Clinical Impression:
        A brief 2–3 sentence narrative summarizing key issues.
    - Issues/Problems:
        For each issue (limit to 3), provide:
            - Assessment: 1–2 sentences summarizing the issue and differential
            - Plan: 1–2 sentences summarizing tests, treatments, and referrals

Follow-Up:
    - Instructions for emergent follow-up care or monitoring:
        If nothing specific is provided, write: "Instruct patient to contact the clinic if symptoms worsen or do not improve within a week, or if test results indicate further evaluation is needed."

        f"""You are an advanced medical documentation assistant with expertise in composing clear, detailed, and professional physician-like narrative SOAP notes. Your task is to create a coherent note that follows the SOAP template provided, but in a narrative style. 

Instructions:

1. Integrate the patient's demographics into a narrative paragraph rather than bullet points. For example: "This is a 30-year-old Black male who has been receiving care at our clinic for approximately 3 months. He speaks English and present today, 04/09/2020, for follow-up..." etc. Do not use sentences like: "This narrative-style SOAP note" or "This narrative note pertains" or "is currently alive."
2. Include the patient's primary diagnosis of asthma (as identified by the ICD code) first, then list secondary and tertiary diagnoses—such as various asthma subtypes or mental health conditions—by grouping similar ICD codes together. Use the counts solely to gauge severity or chronicity, without explicitly mentioning numerical values or specific code details in the final note.
3. Create a cohesive, made-up physical exam occurred on the visit date provided that aligns with the patient's primary or frequent conditions (e.g., findings related to respiratory status, mental status if depressive disorder is mentioned, etc.).
4. When referencing labs (LOINC codes), do not include the codes themselves or their counts. Instead, mention their common names (e.g., "Aspartate Aminotransferase" instead of "AST") and any relevant significance or normal/abnormal findings suggested by repeated monitoring.
5. Use a SOAP format:
   - **Visit Information**: Provide the patient_num, encounter_num, {{visit_date}} in structured way as specified on the SOAP template.
   - **Subjective**: Summarize the patient's chief complaints, relevant history (asthma), and background. Make sure that current medications are mentioned. Write in full sentences.
   - **Objective**: Provide a plausible and narrative physical exam, vital signs, symptoms, and any relevant lab findings. 
   - **Assessment**: Offer a clinical impression or diagnosis summary, grouping chronic issues together.
   - **Plan**: Describe treatment plans, further testing, referrals, or follow-up.
6. Use professional medical language but keep it comprehensible and succinct. Do not introduce details not supported by the data. If a detail (like an allergy) is not mentioned, omit it.
7. Do not list the codes explicitly (ICD, LOINC, NDC). Reference them conceptually (e.g., "This patient’s record indicates repeated tests for liver function" or "He has multiple diagnoses related to various forms of asthma...").
8. Focus on transforming all relevant data into a cohesive narrative physician’s note while respecting the SOAP structure. Ensure the final product reads naturally and includes a short, invented physical exam that matches the patient's conditions.
9. When available, review the latest patient's note to build a more accurate patient narrative. Include a progress from their last visit and mention past visit dates when available, however focus on the NEW patient summary provided. 
10. Limit the **Objective section** to a single paragraph summarizing only relevant exam findings and labs. Do not list every body system unless it's related to the primary issue.
11. For the **Assessment and Plan**, summarize each issue in 2–3 sentences total, combining diagnosis, differential, treatment plan, and next steps. Avoid redundancy and unnecessary elaboration.
12. Avoid repeating findings from the Subjective or Objective sections.

Please produce a single, integrated narrative note that respects these guidelines, using the following SOAP template in a cohesive manner: {soap_template}.
