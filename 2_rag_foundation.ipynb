    "# Using LLM + Embeddings to Search Patient Notes (RAG - Basics)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use **local embeddings** and a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** approach to search and analyze clinical notes stored in an i2b2-like format. You'll learn how to decode raw notes, embed them using the MiniLM model, perform semantic search with FAISS, and generate structured clinical responses using a local LLM (e.g., Qwen or LLaMA 3 via Ollama).\n",

    "- Filtering to include only the **most relevant and recent** patient notes\n",

    "- Using a local LLM (Ollama) to generate clinically relevant summaries\n",

    "Each cell builds on the previous one to demonstrate a complete, hands-on RAG pipeline adapted for **clinical informatics** use cases using familiar i2b2-style data.\n"

She communicates primarily in Spanish and presents today for a follow-up visit regarding persistent anxiety and depressive symptoms, as well as management of chronic cough and recurrent gastrointestinal discomfort. Additionally, she is seeking advice on long-term contraceptive options following dissatisfaction with her current method.\n\nThe patient reports a persistent cough that has been ongoing for the past two weeks, producing green sputum and accompanied by intermittent fever, chills, and general fatigue. She also describes ongoing gastrointestinal discomfort characterized by epigastric pain, bloating, and nausea, particularly after meals. There have been no recent dietary changes. \n\nThe patient is currently taking Benzonatate for cough management and Prednisone; however, these medications have not completely alleviated her symptoms. She also takes Apri for contraception and Nortriptyline Hydrochloride for neuropathic pain and mood management. She reports improvement in mood and pain control but continues to experience gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea associated with her contraceptive pill. The patient has no known drug allergies.\n\nHer past medical history includes chronic cervicitis and endocervicitis with recurrent abnormal Pap smears, generalized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, and bipolar disorder. She has not undergone any major surgeries.\n\nThe patient lives with her family and works as a homemaker. She leads a healthy lifestyle, does not smoke, drinks alcohol occasionally, and does not use recreational drugs. \n\n**Objective:**\n\nThe patient appears moderately ill but is not in acute distress. Vital signs include a temperature of 99.6¬∞F, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 118/76 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. The respiratory examination reveals decreased breath sounds and crackles at the base of the left lung, suggesting an ongoing respiratory infection. The abdominal examination shows mild epigastric tenderness without rebound tenderness or guarding; bowel sounds are present and normal. There is no hepatosplenomegaly. The gynecological examination was not performed during this visit. The neck examination reveals no visible deformities. Cardiovascular examination indicates a regular heart rate and rhythm with no abnormal sounds. Recent lab tests show an elevated white blood cell count, indicating infection, while liver function tests are within normal limits.\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n1. Acute bronchitis with a likely secondary bacterial infection, as evidenced by persistent cough, sputum production, and fever.\n2. Chronic cervicitis and endocervicitis, necessitating further evaluation due to recurrent symptoms and abnormal Pap smear results.\n3. Gastritis, likely exacerbated by oral contraceptive use and possibly dietary factors, presenting with epigastric pain, nausea, and bloating.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1. The patient will continue with the current antibiotic regimen to address the acute bronchitis and will be monitored for signs of improvement or worsening infection.\n2. Recommend dietary modifications and prescribe a proton pump inhibitor to manage gastritis symptoms.\n3. Schedule a gynecological consultation to further evaluate abnormal Pap smear results and ongoing issues with chronic cervicitis.\n4. Discuss various long-term contraceptive options, considering the side effects experienced with the current oral contraceptive, and make necessary adjustments.\n5. Reinforce the importance of adhering to prescribed medications, maintaining adequate hydration, and ensuring rest. Educate the patient about recognizing signs of worsening infection and instruct to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms escalate.\n\n**Follow-Up:**\n\nInstruct the patient to contact the clinic if symptoms worsen or do not improve within a week, or if test results indicate further evaluation is needed. Educate the patient on the importance of adhering to the treatment plan and attending follow-up appointments to monitor progress and reassess treatment efficacy.\n```"

    "## 2. Decode, Embed and Store Clinical Notes in a FAISS Vector Store (In-Memory)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, we embed full clinical notes and store them in a **FAISS** vector store, which enables efficient similarity search. We use a lightweight transformer model (`MiniLM`) to convert each note into a semantic vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "- **2.1**: Embed clinical notes using the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model from Hugging Face.\n",
    "- **2.2**: View an embedded document along with its metadata and vector representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use This Approach?\n",
    "\n",
    "Storing entire notes is useful when:\n",
    "- You want to preserve the full clinical context for each patient.\n",
    "- Your downstream use case (e.g., summarization or structured extraction) requires complete narrative input.\n",
    "- The notes are concise enough to fit within the input limits of an LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method simplifies retrieval workflows by allowing you to work with whole documents rather than fragmented chunks.\n",

    "## 3. Retrieving Clinical Notes with Similarity Score (RAG Retrieval)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we perform semantic search over embedded clinical notes using a FAISS vector store and a locally generated query vector. We use similarity scores to evaluate the relevance of each match to the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Retrieval Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Embed a Query (Step 3.1)**\n",
    "   - Converts a natural language question into a numerical vector using the same MiniLM model used to embed the notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Similarity Search with Scores (Step 3.2)**\n",
    "   - Retrieves the top-k clinical notes ranked by cosine similarity to the query.\n",
    "   - Includes similarity scores for transparency and ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Score Threshold Filtering (Step 3.3)**\n",
    "   - Filters out matches with low similarity scores.\n",
    "   - Helps improve the precision and clinical relevance of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use These Techniques?\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarity search helps identify notes most relevant to a user-defined question or condition. Threshold filtering ensures:\n",
    "- Only strong matches are considered for downstream tasks like summarization\n",
    "- Noisy or unrelated content is excluded\n",
    "- Each result can be justified based on a similarity score\n",

    "## 4. Generating Structured Responses with an LLM (RAG Retrieval)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we take the clinical notes retrieved via semantic search and pass them into a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate structured, clinically meaningful responses. This is the final step in the **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Creating a Prompt Template for LLM Querying (Step 4.1)**\n",
    "   - Defines a reusable prompt structure for analyzing and summarizing clinical notes.\n",
    "   - Ensures each response includes patient metadata and clear, structured outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Invoking LLM with Retrieved Context (Step 4.2)**\n",
    "   - Inserts the top-retrieved clinical notes into the prompt.\n",
    "   - Sends the prompt to a local LLM (e.g., Qwen2 via Ollama) for structured generation.\n",
    "   - Returns a summary that directly answers the user‚Äôs medical query.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "This step demonstrates how LLMs can synthesize information from real patient notes to produce:\n",
    "- Patient-specific summaries\n",
    "- Answered clinical questions\n",
    "- Traceable outputs with structured identifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "This capability is essential for use cases like clinical decision support, patient-facing summaries, or intelligent search interfaces.\n",
