    "# Using LLM + Embeddings to Search Patient Notes (RAG - Basics)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use **local embeddings** and **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** to search and analyze clinical notes stored in an i2b2-like format. It shows how to decode notes, embed them using MiniLM, retrieve similar cases using FAISS, and use a local LLM (e.g., LLaMA 3 via Ollama) to generate structured, clinical responses.\n",

    "- Decoding binhex-encoded clinical notes\n",
    "- Creating semantic vector embeddings with `MiniLM`\n",
    "- Building a local FAISS vector store\n",
    "- Performing similarity search and understanding cosine scores\n",
    "- Filtering to only include the **most recent encounter per patient**\n",
    "- Injecting retrieved context into a structured prompt\n",
    "- Using a local LLM (Ollama) to generate medical insights\n",

She reports experiencing increased shortness of breath, persistent coughing, and wheezing, which have become particularly troublesome at night and during physical exertion. These symptoms align with her diagnosed cough variant asthma. Additionally, she mentions experiencing dizziness and occasional irregular menstrual cycles. There are no reports of chest pain or hemoptysis.\n\nHer past medical history is significant for asthma, cardiac dysrhythmia, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and unspecified vaginitis. She completed a course of Penicillin for a previously diagnosed urinary tract infection but continues to experience urinary frequency. She has no history of smoking or alcohol consumption. Currently, she is on Albuterol Sulfate tablets, Maxair Autohaler, and Prilosec capsules for asthma and GERD, as well as Apri for contraception, Acyclovir for viral management, and Tetracycline for an unspecified reason. She resides with her sister and works part-time in retail, dealing with considerable stress related to her job and studies.\n\nOn physical examination, she appeared alert and oriented, with vital signs recorded as follows: blood pressure 110/72 mmHg, heart rate 78 beats per minute, respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and temperature 99.0Â°F. The respiratory exam uncovered bilateral expiratory wheezes with an extended expiratory phase, though there were no signs of accessory muscle use or cyanosis. Cardiovascular exam was unremarkable, demonstrating a regular heart rate and rhythm without murmurs. Abdominal examination showed no tenderness or masses. The musculoskeletal exam noted mild lower back tenderness without significant deformity or neurological deficits. Her skin remained clear of any new lesions, indicating controlled dermatitis. Recent laboratory tests, including complete blood count and urinalysis, returned within standard ranges.\n\nThe patient presents with an exacerbation of asthma that is not sufficiently managed by her current treatment regimen. The recurrent urinary symptoms suggest a possible relapse of her urinary tract infection. Mild musculoskeletal back pain was also noted, likely strain-related given her occupation and stress levels.\n\nTo improve asthma management, an escalation in the Flovent dosage is recommended alongside the addition of a leukotriene receptor antagonist. Emphasis on inhaler techniques and rigorous adherence to her medication regimen is highlighted. A repeat urinalysis is ordered to investigate the persistent urinary symptoms, and pending results, a culture and sensitivity test may be necessary. For her back pain, a referral to physical therapy for targeted strengthening and stretching exercises is suggested, supplemented with NSAIDs for pain control.\n\nThe patient is advised to contact the clinic urgently if her breathing difficulties intensify or do not improve within a week, or if her urinary symptoms worsen. Educational resources on medication usage, stress management strategies, and emergency asthma protocols were provided. A follow-up appointment is set for one month to reassess her asthma control and monitor any new developments in her condition. Immediate medical attention is recommended should she experience severe respiratory distress or notable aggravation of urinary symptoms.\n```"

      "text/markdown": "Based on the provided clinical notes, there are three patients with asthma taking Fluticasone and Albuterol:\n\n1. Patient Num: 1000000123, Gender: Male, Age: 19 years, Race: Indian  \n   Visit Date: November 27, 2002\n   Summary: This patient is a 19-year-old Indian male with asthma that has been under their care for management. He experienced an increase in asthma attacks since his last visit three months prior, leading to sleep disturbances and academic difficulties. His symptoms include wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness exacerbated by physical activities and cold weather. He uses a rescue inhaler three to four times daily due to inadequate control with current medications including fluticasone/salmeterol and albuterol.\n\n2. Patient Num: 1000000005, Gender: Female, Age: 30 years, Race: Hispanic  \n   Visit Date: July 2, 2003\n   Summary: This patient is a 30-year-old Hispanic female with persistent symptoms of asthma that have worsened over the past two weeks despite regular use of her medications. She reports increased shortness of breath and nocturnal coughing which disrupts her sleep. Her condition seems to be exacerbated by allergen exposure, requiring temporary increases in her medication dosage including fluticasone inhaler (daily) and albuterol as needed.\n\n3. Patient Num: 1000000011, Gender: Female, Age: 55 years, Race: Caucasian  \n   Visit Date: March 16, 2004\n   Summary: This patient is a 55-year-old Caucasian female with persistent shortness of breath and nocturnal cough that hinders her sleep. Despite adhering to her prescribed medication regimen which includes fluticasone inhaler twice daily and albuterol as needed for asthma management, she experiences difficulty in controlling her symptoms. She also has additional health concerns like hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and cervical dysplasia."
